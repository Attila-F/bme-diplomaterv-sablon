\makeglossaries

Through the thesis I've tried to express the ideas and concepts as clearly as possible, but there are a good deal of, mostly nautical expressions, that consistently omitting or replacing them would do to the intelligibility more harm than good. I have often found myself wondering about the meaning of certain terms, and have decided to include a glossary. By any means, skip this part for now, but remember to check back if you have found yourself facing a sentence filled with marine, military or engineering notions.
