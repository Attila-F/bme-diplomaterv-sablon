\section{Measurements and results}

Testing the navigation algorithm the boat is difficult in the marine environment. Exploiting the model-based design of the system enables us to validate the navigation software using a different measurement platform. The vehicle control layer of the boat can be substituted for a car's. Using the predefined input and output interfaces and replacing some auxiliary elements of the electronics, an Unmanned Ground Vehicle can be prepared for the task.
