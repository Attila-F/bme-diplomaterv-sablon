\section{Conclusion}
This document is meant to succeeds my previous work\cite{aau}. Several major functionalities have been added, and the engine behind under the hood has been changed, and will keep changing.

My most important observation during the Project Laboratory I. was that the perceived significance of the system components might differ from the reality. The successful implementation of the different pathplanning systems and navigation required a very solid and relatively simple Map object, that can be relied on.

With the major components of the HLC now complete, up and running, it's possible to move to the next phase. In Project Laboratory II. the LLC will be designed, the communication protocol between the objects and the ship itself, in order to accomplish a more-or-less working prototype by the end of 2013.
